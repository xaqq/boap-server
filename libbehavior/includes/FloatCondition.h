	FloatCondition<> condition(&func,CLOSE,5.0f);

	To wrap the static method "sMethod" of the class "Class", one would do this:
	FloatCondition<> condition(&Class::sMethod,CLOSE,5.0f);

	To wrap a non-static class member, FloatCondition must be parameterized with the class's type.
	For example, to wrap the method "method" of class "Class", one would do this:
	FloatCondition<Class> condition(&Class:method,CLOSE,5.0f);
