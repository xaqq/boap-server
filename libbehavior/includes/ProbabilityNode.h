For example, if there were two children with a weight of one, each would have a 50% chance of being executed.
If another child with a weight of eight were added, the previous children would have a 10% chance of being executed, and the new child would have an 80% chance of being executed.
This weight system is intended to facilitate the fine-tuning of behaviors.
